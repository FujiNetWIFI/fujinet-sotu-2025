* topics

** OTA, but on our terms.

- Jaime Johnston (@idolpx) implemented a custom OTA firmware update
  that only needs 384K of flash memory.

- Will be in next production release (1.6)

** NEW EMULATOR: ATARI800

- @mozzwald added NetSIO support to Atari800

- @mozzwald also got it working on Miyoo Mini. :)
  
- Emulator runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS, ARM devices

- Less features than Altirra, but more lightweight.

- Almost all FujiNet functions Working

- Only lacking:
  - HSIO support
  - ATX support

** New Platform: RS-232

- Uses RS-232 Interface

- Speeds from 300 to 115200 Baud

- First Platform support: PC MS-DOS

- Uses DTR for synchronization, RI for Network Interrupt.

*** PC Support Details

- Implemented via CONFIG.SYS driver (FUJINET.SYS)

- Provides:
  - 8 Virtual Drives, can use any raw disk image.
  - INT F5 Interface for calling FujiNet functions
  - INT 17 Interface for Virtual Printer
  - MS-DOS redirector (FNSHARE.EXE) for file level sharing

- Other transports planned
  - Parallel Port
  - ISA (and PCjr) bus design

- INT F5 abstracts the transport.

** New Game: Fujitzee

- Yahtzee game!
  
- Written by Eric Carr, who also wrote 5 Card Stud

- Written in cross-platform C

- Versions for:
  - ATARI
  - Apple ][
  - TRS-80 Color Computer
  - (Anyone want to help port the Adam version?)

- Accessible via Game Lobby
  or by loading directly via TNFS.

** New Demo: Bouncy World

- A networked spatial simulation

- Written by Mark Fisher

- Server written in Kotlin

- Clients written in C

** Platform Progress: Atari 2600 (VCS)

- Gennaro Tortone ported PlusCart(+) from STM32 to ESP32.

- Uses an ESP32 for the Network

- Uses an RP2040 for the bus and ROM interface.

- First full example of a bus-driven FujiNet

- Can load existing 2600 games directly from Network

- Provides same Network Protocols as other FujiNets

- Wolfgang Stubig of PlusCart made a 5 Card Stud client

** Platform Hardware: ESP32S3

- FujiNet was ported forward to the ESP32 S3

- Bus driven FujiNets will use this by default.

- More fast RAM (512K up from 320K)

- More GPIOs (33)

- More flexible USB host

- Can be hooked to RP2040 or 2350 via USB for fast interconnect.

** Config: Recursive Search

- Filter in config can now be preceeded with "!"
  to specify a case insensitive; recursive search.

- e.g. "!Dig Dug"
  to find all copies of Dig Dug from the current directory, forward.

** CONFIG: CONFIG-NG

- Written by Mark Fisher

- For Atari 8-bit systems.

- An alternative to the standard Config.

- UI matches Ultimate 1MB in aesthetics.

- Written in Assembler

- Faster directory traversal.

- Can be loaded by placing the ATR on the SD card,
  and selecting it as the alternate CONFIG program
  in the Web UI.

** Firmware: WebDAV Server

- Copy to/from your PC directly onto FujiNet's SD card.

- Accessible via http://fujinet/dav/

- Works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS
